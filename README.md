# JS30
30 days of JS.
Here we will be recovering 30 Vanilla javascript (javascript without any framework or library/simply pure javascript) in 30 days.
1) Drum Kit--
In this project we have grabbed keys and sounds attached to them and when you press down the selected keys you will feel the music.
2) Clock--
This is a very simple project.We will be using Date() func of javascript and transform it using ()deg val for the selected part. 
3) Array Cardio/Exercise--
Here we have gone through different array methods such as sort(), reduce(), filter(), etc. Apart from this, using these methods we grabbed a wikipedia page of n-charc and fetched for a particular data such as all the links or the statements containing a particular word which we have performed in this exercise.
